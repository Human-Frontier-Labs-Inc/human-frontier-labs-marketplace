## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-19

### Added

**Core Functionality:**
- `diagnose_issue()` - Comprehensive issue diagnosis for Bubble Tea apps
- `apply_best_practices()` - Validation against 11 expert tips
- `debug_performance()` - Performance bottleneck identification
- `suggest_architecture()` - Architecture pattern recommendations
- `fix_layout_issues()` - Lipgloss layout problem solving
- `comprehensive_bubbletea_analysis()` - All-in-one health check orchestrator

**Issue Detection:**
- Blocking operations in Update() and View()
- Hardcoded terminal dimensions
- Missing terminal recovery code
- Message ordering assumptions
- Model complexity analysis
- Goroutine leak detection
- Layout arithmetic errors
- String concatenation inefficiencies
- Regex compilation in hot paths
- Memory allocation patterns

**Best Practices Validation:**
- Tip 1: Fast event loop validation
- Tip 2: Debug message dumping capability check
- Tip 3: Live reload setup detection
- Tip 4: Receiver method pattern validation
- Tip 5: Message ordering handling
- Tip 6: Model tree architecture analysis
- Tip 7: Layout arithmetic best practices
- Tip 8: Terminal recovery implementation
- Tip 9: teatest usage
- Tip 10: VHS demo presence
- Tip 11: Additional resources reference

**Performance Analysis:**
- Update() execution time estimation
- View() rendering complexity analysis
- String operation optimization suggestions
- Loop efficiency checking
- Allocation pattern detection
- Concurrent operation safety validation
- I/O operation placement verification

**Architecture Recommendations:**
- Pattern detection (flat, multi-view, model tree, component-based, state machine)
- Complexity scoring (0-100)
- Refactoring step generation
- Code template provision for recommended patterns
- Model tree, multi-view, and state machine examples

**Layout Fixes:**
- Hardcoded dimension detection and fixes
- Padding/border accounting
- Terminal resize handling
- Overflow prevention
- lipgloss.Height()/Width() usage validation

**Utilities:**
- Go code parser for model, Update(), View(), Init() extraction
- Custom message type detection
- tea.Cmd function analysis
- Bubble Tea component usage finder
- State machine enum extraction
- Comprehensive validation framework

**Documentation:**
- Complete SKILL.md (8,000+ words)
- README with usage examples
- Common issues reference
- Performance optimization guide
- Layout best practices guide
- Architecture patterns catalog
- Installation guide
- Decision documentation

**Testing:**
- Unit tests for all 6 core functions
- Integration test suite
- Validation test coverage
- Test fixtures for common scenarios

### Data Coverage

**Issue Categories:**
- Performance (7 checks)
- Layout (6 checks)
- Reliability (3 checks)
- Architecture (2 checks)
- Memory (2 checks)

**Best Practice Tips:**
- 11 expert tips from tip-bubbltea-apps.md
- Compliance scoring
- Recommendation generation

**Performance Thresholds:**
- Update() target: <16ms
- View() target: <3ms
- Goroutine leak detection
- Memory allocation analysis

### Known Limitations

- Requires local tip-bubbltea-apps.md file for full best practices validation
- Go code parsing uses regex (not AST) for speed
- Performance estimates are based on patterns, not actual profiling
- Architecture suggestions are heuristic-based

### Planned for v2.0

- AST-based Go parsing for more accurate analysis
- Integration with pprof for actual performance data
- Automated fix application (not just suggestions)
- Custom best practices rule definitions
- Visual reports with charts/graphs
- CI/CD integration for automated checks

## [Unreleased]

### Planned

- Support for Bubble Tea v1.0+ features
- More architecture patterns (event sourcing, CQRS)
- Performance regression detection
- Code complexity metrics (cyclomatic complexity)
- Dependency analysis
- Security vulnerability checks
