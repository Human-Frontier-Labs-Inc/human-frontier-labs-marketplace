# Architecture Decisions

Documentation of key design decisions for Bubble Tea Designer skill.

## Data Source Decision

**Decision**: Use local charm-examples-inventory instead of API
**Rationale**:
- ✅ No rate limits or authentication needed
- ✅ Fast lookups (local file system)
- ✅ Complete control over inventory structure
- ✅ Offline capability
- ✅ Inventory can be updated independently

**Alternatives Considered**:
- GitHub API: Rate limits, requires authentication
- Web scraping: Fragile, slow, unreliable
- Embedded database: Adds complexity, harder to update

**Trade-offs**:
- User needs to have inventory locally (optional but recommended)
- Updates require re-cloning repository

## Analysis Approach

**Decision**: 6 separate analysis functions + 1 comprehensive orchestrator
**Rationale**:
- ✅ Modularity - each function has single responsibility
- ✅ Testability - easy to test individual components
- ✅ Flexibility - users can call specific analyses
- ✅ Composability - orchestrator combines as needed

**Structure**:
1. analyze_requirements() - NLP requirement extraction
2. map_components() - Component scoring and selection
3. select_patterns() - Example file matching
4. design_architecture() - Structure generation
5. generate_workflow() - Implementation planning
6. comprehensive_tui_design_report() - All-in-one

## Component Matching Algorithm

**Decision**: Keyword-based scoring with manual taxonomy
**Rationale**:
- ✅ Transparent - users can see why components selected
- ✅ Predictable - consistent results
- ✅ Fast - O(n) search with indexing
- ✅ Maintainable - easy to add new components

**Alternatives Considered**:
- ML-based matching: Overkill, requires training data
- Fuzzy matching: Less accurate for technical terms
- Rule-based expert system: Too rigid

**Scoring System**:
- Keyword match: 60 points max
- Use case match: 40 points max
- Total: 0-100 score per component

## Architecture Generation Strategy

**Decision**: Template-based with customization
**Rationale**:
- ✅ Generates working code immediately
- ✅ Follows Bubble Tea best practices
- ✅ Customizable per archetype
- ✅ Educational - shows proper patterns

**Templates Include**:
- Model struct with components
- Init() with proper initialization
- Update() skeleton with message routing
- View() with component rendering

## Validation Strategy

**Decision**: Multi-layer validation (requirements, components, architecture, workflow)
**Rationale**:
- ✅ Early error detection
- ✅ Quality assurance
- ✅ Helpful feedback to users
- ✅ Catches incomplete designs

**Validation Levels**:
- CRITICAL: Must fix (empty description, no components)
- WARNING: Should review (low coverage, many components)
- INFO: Optional improvements

## File Organization

**Decision**: Modular scripts with shared utilities
**Rationale**:
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Reusable utilities
- ✅ Easy to test
- ✅ Maintainable codebase

**Structure**:
```
scripts/
  main analysis scripts (6)
  utils/
    shared utilities
    validators/
      validation logic
```

## Pattern Matching Approach

**Decision**: Inventory-based with ranking
**Rationale**:
- ✅ Leverages existing examples
- ✅ Provides concrete references
- ✅ Study order optimization
- ✅ Realistic time estimates

**Ranking Factors**:
- Component usage overlap
- Complexity match
- Code quality/clarity

## Documentation Strategy

**Decision**: Comprehensive references with patterns and best practices
**Rationale**:
- ✅ Educational value
- ✅ Self-contained skill
- ✅ Reduces external documentation dependency
- ✅ Examples for every pattern

**References Created**:
- Component guide (what each component does)
- Design patterns (common architectures)
- Best practices (dos and don'ts)
- Example designs (complete real-world cases)

## Performance Considerations

**Optimizations**:
- Inventory loaded once, cached in memory
- Pre-computed component taxonomy
- Fast keyword matching (no regex)
- Minimal allocations in hot paths

**Trade-offs**:
- Memory usage: ~5MB for loaded inventory
- Startup time: ~100ms for inventory loading
- Analysis time: <1 second for complete report

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for v2.0:
- Interactive mode for requirement refinement
- Code generation (full implementation, not just scaffolding)
- Live preview of designs
- Integration with Go module initialization
- Custom component definitions
- Save/load design sessions
