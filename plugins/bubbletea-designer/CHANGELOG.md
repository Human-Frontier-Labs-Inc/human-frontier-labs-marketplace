All notable changes to Bubble Tea Designer will be documented here.

Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
Versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-18

### Added

**Core Functionality:**
- `comprehensive_tui_design_report()` - All-in-one design generation
- `extract_requirements()` - Natural language requirement parsing
- `map_to_components()` - Intelligent component selection
- `select_relevant_patterns()` - Example pattern matching
- `design_architecture()` - Architecture generation with diagrams
- `generate_implementation_workflow()` - Step-by-step implementation plans

**Data Sources:**
- charm-examples-inventory integration (46 examples)
- Component taxonomy with 14 components
- Pattern templates for 5 common archetypes
- Comprehensive keyword database

**Analysis Capabilities:**
- TUI archetype classification (9 types)
- Feature extraction from descriptions
- Component scoring algorithm (0-100)
- Pattern relevance ranking
- Architecture diagram generation (ASCII)
- Time estimation for implementation

**Utilities:**
- Inventory loader with automatic path detection
- Component matcher with keyword scoring
- Template generator for Go code scaffolding
- ASCII diagram generator for architecture visualization
- Requirement validator
- Design validator

**Documentation:**
- Complete SKILL.md (7,200 words)
- Component guide with 14 components
- Design patterns reference (10 patterns)
- Architecture best practices
- Example designs (5 complete examples)
- Installation guide
- Architecture decisions documentation

### Data Coverage

**Components Supported:**
- Input: textinput, textarea, filepicker, autocomplete
- Display: viewport, table, list, pager, paginator
- Feedback: spinner, progress, timer, stopwatch
- Navigation: tabs, help
- Layout: lipgloss

**Archetypes Recognized:**
- file-manager, installer, dashboard, form, viewer
- chat, table-viewer, menu, editor

**Patterns Available:**
- Single-view, multi-view, master-detail
- Progress tracker, composable views, form flow

### Known Limitations

- Requires charm-examples-inventory for full pattern matching (works without but reduced functionality)
- Archetype classification may need refinement for complex hybrid TUIs
- Code scaffolding is basic (Init/Update/View skeletons only)
- No live preview or interactive refinement yet

### Planned for v2.0

- Interactive requirement refinement
- Full code generation (not just scaffolding)
- Custom component definitions
- Integration with Go toolchain (go mod init, etc.)
- Design session save/load
- Live TUI preview

## [Unreleased]

### Planned

- Add support for custom components
- Improve archetype classification accuracy
- Expand pattern library
- Add code completion features
- Performance optimizations for large inventories
